However, the game is not free to play. You need to pay â¬ 15.00 to unlock the full version of the game, which includes more tournaments, more opponents, more items and more features. If you don't want to pay for the game, you might be tempted to look for a hacked version of the game that gives you unlimited money, experience and stats.
 
There are many websites that claim to offer a hacked version of Swords and Sandals 3: Solo Ultratus, but most of them are either fake, infected with malware or require you to download suspicious software.

However, Kongregate also has a feature called "hacks", which are user-generated modifications that alter the game's code and behavior.
 
One of these hacks is called "Swords and Sandals 3: Solo Ultratus Hacked", which was created by a user named G7R. This hack gives you unlimited money, experience and stats in the game. You can also set your level, wins and losses as you wish. However, you need to be careful not to set any of your stats to more than 50, or the hack will fail and you'll end up dead.
 
To use this hack, you need to have an account on Kongregate, which is free and easy to create. You also need to have Adobe Flash Player installed on your browser, which is necessary to run the game. Once you have these requirements, you can follow these steps:
